# Composition Process Tracker
The Composition Project Tracker (CPT) is a web-based tool which will allow composers to self-report the actions they take while composing a piece. 

## Requirements
CPT is built on Liszt by NoteForge, and this code currently requires that proprietary backend.

## To-Do items:
1. Revise Calculation code
1. Better name?
